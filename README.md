# \# 🧹 ML Imputation Project

# 

# A comprehensive framework for handling missing data in machine learning workflows.  

# This project implements multiple imputation strategies (Simple, Statistical, KNN, Iterative, and Random Forest–based) and provides comparison + visualization utilities.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 🚀 Features

# \- Analyze missing data (counts, percentages, per-column breakdown)

# \- Apply different imputation methods:

# &nbsp; - Simple Imputation (Mean/Mode)

# &nbsp; - Statistical (Mean/Median for skewed data)

# &nbsp; - KNN-based Imputation

# &nbsp; - Iterative Imputation (MICE)

# &nbsp; - Advanced Random Forest–based Imputation

# \- Compare methods based on completeness and numerical statistics

# \- Visualize imputation effects (histograms and missingness heatmaps)

# 

# \## 📂 Dataset

# 

# The sample dataset used in this project is from Kaggle:  

# \[Retail Product Dataset with Missing Values](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himelsarder/retail-product-dataset-with-missing-values)  

# 

# \- Place the CSV file in `data/raw/` as `synthetic\_dataset.csv` (or rename accordingly).  

# \- This dataset contains missing values suitable for testing different imputation methods.
